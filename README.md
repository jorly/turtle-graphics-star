# turtle-graphics-star
Python program that draws a star using Turtle Graphics

Uses a loop with turtle graphics to draw a star pattern that has a user specified number of points. First, asks the user how many points they want on the star. Then a star is drawn by having the turtle trace its perimeter. 

Algorithm: The inner angle of a star point A will be equal to 360◦ divided by the number of points on the star: A = 360◦/points.  The concave angle between star points B will be twice the inner angle.
